## Interactive Map of Colonel's Bequest (an adventure game by Sierra On-Line, 1989).

This is an experiment to add an interactive map to the colonelsbequest.net website (when it will relaunch, hopefuly, one day...).

It implements an interactive map using a very simple path-finding algorithm and makes this available via a front-end, developed in React.

It is in early development at the moment.
